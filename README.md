# ChuangWhiteheadLopez_ENV797_TSA_FinalProject
ERCOT Load Forecast

Plan:
Sat-Sun: organizing data
- More recent pull of load data
- See if we can pull more years of data (we can also choose to just download csv files from the website, which might be easier!)
- Website where we can also just download files: https://www.gridstatus.io/datasets
- Sample that's super similar to what we're doing: https://github.com/ENV797/TSA_Sp25/blob/main/Project/sample_projects/Sample1.pdf

Sun: Running 5-8 different models

Mon: putting slides together!
